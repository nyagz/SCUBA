# SCUBA

Code for my final year dissertation project for decompression algorithms used in SCUBA diving

To be able to run this project the repository should be downloaded and cd'd into.

Once in the SCUBA directory, a diver can run each version of the decompression algorithm using their respectful Test class. Example's can be seen within Buhlmann.Test for planning a dive profile.
