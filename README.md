# SCUBA

Code for my final year dissertation project for decompression algorithms used in SCUBA diving
<<<<<<< HEAD

To be able to run this project the repository should be downloaded and cd'd into.

Once in the SCUBA directory, a diver can run each version of the decompression algorithm using their respectful Test class. Example's can be seen within Buhlmann.Test for planning a dive profile.
